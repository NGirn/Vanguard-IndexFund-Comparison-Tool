# Vanguard IndexFund Comparison Tool

You can use this tool to find out what the estimated gain would be if you invested in various Vanguard Investment Funds.

This tool also tells you what the risk level of the fund it so you can compare the returns plus risk to the other funds.

All that is required from the user is the amount they wish to invest, and then the total number of years they wish to invest for.

The calculations are based on the average yearly returns since 2000/2001.
